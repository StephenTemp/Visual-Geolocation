# Visual-Geolocation [Data]
As a result of storage limitations and respect to the _CRCV_ work, the full _Google Street View_ dataset is not included here. However, for the sake of replication, a sample folder is included to demonstrate the format convenient to running the code.

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/GMCP_Geolocalization/)
